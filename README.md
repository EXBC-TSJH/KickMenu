# KickMenu
GTA5 Kick else player ,reference YimMenu

-----------------chinese------------------------
这个项目是根据YimMenu写出来的(https://github.com/YimMenu/YimMenu)

这个菜单可以通过点击按钮来实现分离踢玩家(向其他玩家发送移除指定玩家命令)

可以在Kick.hpp和Kick.cpp中添加踢出函数,
在pointers.cpp中更新特征码
因为分离踢可能会被"rage"移除(我觉得不太可能)

写这个项目的主要精力都花费到了Ui.hpp和Ui.cpp,因为我之前根本就没用过imgui(如果觉得这个Ui很难看,在Ui.cpp->DrawUi函数中从新写一个)

总结:这个菜单写着玩的,不懂的自己琢磨

This project is based on YimMenu written (https://github.com/YimMenu/YimMenu)

This menu can be separated by clicking the button to remove the player (send the command to other players to remove the specified player).

You can add Kick out functions to kick. hpp and kick. cpp,
Update the feature code in pointers.cpp
Because the separation kick will probably be removed by the "rage" (I think it's unlikely)

Ui.hpp and ui.cpp were my main efforts in writing this project, because I had never used imgui before (if you think this Ui is ugly, check ui.cpp -&gt; Write a new one in our DrawUi function.

Conclusion: This menu is written to play, don't understand their own thinking
